# Sugar Lens â€“ Diabetes Risk Prediction & Analysis

# Problem Statement

Diabetes is a chronic condition affecting millions globally, with rising cases in India. Early prediction can save lives, reduce complications, and guide lifestyle changes.
Sugar - Lens is an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning project focused on predicting diabetes risk using public health data from India and the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset.

# Overview

Sugar Lens is a healthcare-focused data science project that predicts diabetes risk using real-world datasets. By combining Indian public health data and the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, this project aims to help identify high-risk individuals and assist in public health decision-making.

# Tools & Technologies

* Languages: Python, SQL (MySQL)

* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

* ML Model: Random Forest

* Techniques: PCA, Feature Engineering, Outlier Handling, EDA

* BI Tool: Power BI (DAX, KPIs, Slicers)

* Others: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

 #  Project Workflow

# 1. Data Collection & Cleaning

* Imported datasets into SQL and merged using JOINs

* Removed duplicates, handled missing values

* Filtered and standardized using SQL + Pandas

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed patterns in glucose level, age, BMI, pregnancies, and insulin

* Created distribution plots and correlations

# 3. Feature Engineering

* Created BMI groups, Age bands, and binary risk indicators

* Handled outliers using IQR

* Applied PCA to reduce dimensions and improve model speed

# 4. Model Building

* Trained a Random Forest Classifier

* Achieved 90% accuracy in predicting diabetes risk

* Evaluated using Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC

# 5. Power BI Dashboard

* Designed a full dashboard for risk segmentation

* KPIs: Total Patients, Diabetic %, BMI Distribution

* Slicers: Gender, Age Group, Region

* Risk Categories: Low, Moderate, High

# Key Insights

* Patients with high glucose, high BMI, and higher pregnancies showed higher diabetes risk

* Younger patients with healthy BMI had lower risk profiles

* Public health authorities can use these risk segments for targeted intervention

# Learnings
 
 * Practical application of end-to-end data science workflow

 * Strengthened SQL + Python + Power BI integration

 * Real-world understanding of health analytics
